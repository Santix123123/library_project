# *Library_Project:*
### Project Description: 
This project is a web-based library management system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add books, display them in a user-friendly interface, update the read status, and remove books from the library. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to manage an array of book objects and update the display dynamically.

## Technology used:
### Core technologies:
1. **HTML**</span>- For structuring the webpage and creating the book display layout.
2. **CSS**- For styling the interface, making it visually appealing and responsive.
3. **JavaScript**- For handling book data, user interactions, and dynamically updating the DOM.
### Development Tools & Version Control:
1. **Git**- For version control, managing changes, and tracking development progress.
2. **GitHub**-  For hosting the project repository and facilitating collaboration.
### Additional Features & APIs:
1. **LocalStorage API**- To store book data persistently so that it remains after page reloads.
2. **Event Listeners**- For handling form submissions, button clicks, and user interactions.

## Features Implemented:
### Required Features:
1. **Add New Book:** 
Users can input details such as author, title, number of pages, and read status.
2. **Display Books:**
Books are displayed in a list or card format, showcasing their details.
3. **Remove Book:** 
Each book has a remove button to delete it from the library.
4. **Toggle Read Status:**
Books can have their read status toggled (read/unread).
### Additional Features:
1. **Book Search:**
Implemented a search bar to filter books based on title or author.
2. **Persistent Data:**
Used localStorage to keep the book data saved across page reloads.
3. **Book Editing:**
Added functionality to edit book details (e.g., title, author, etc.).

## Installation Instructions:
### 1. Clone the repository:
**Bash:**  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
### 2. Navigate to the project directory:
**Bash:**  cd library-management-system
### 3. Open the index.html file in your browser to start using the application.

## Usage Guidelines:
1. **Add a Book:**
Click on the "New Book" button to open the form, then fill in the book details and submit it to add it to the library.
2. **Remove a Book:**
Click on the "Remove" button next to any book to delete it from the library.
3. **Change Read Status:**
Click on the "Mark as Read" or "Mark as Unread" button to toggle the book's read status.
4. **Search Books:**
Use the search bar at the top to filter books by title or author.

## Future Improvements Planned:
1. ***Responsive Design:***
Improve responsiveness for mobile and tablet views.**!!**
2. ***Book Categories:***
Implement a feature to categorize books (e.g., Fiction, Non-fiction).**!!**
3. ***User Authentication:***
Add user accounts to save their library preferences and books.**!!**
4. ***Book Ratings:***
Allow users to rate books out of 5 stars.**!!**

## Learning Outcomes from This Project:
